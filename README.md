# todo-list-oop :scroll:
## This is a first attempt to create a Object Oriented To-Do List in JavaScript.
## In this basic app you can search for tasks or filter them by category (all/completed/not finished); plus it all sits in your browser's localStorage.
Have fun adding your priorities with the app !
